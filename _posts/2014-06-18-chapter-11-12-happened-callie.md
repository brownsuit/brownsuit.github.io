<em><em><em>"Remember me and bear in mind, a kind true friend is hard to find.. and when you find one kind and true - don't turn off the old one for the new!  (signed) your Grand Mother Harris, June 28, 1962"</em></em></em><strong>

Grandma Harris wrote that quote in every autograph book I had growing up ...  and she was always the first page of all those books!  She had many "sayings" as I've mentioned before.  But if she had a "philosophy" - this would be it!  She had so many friends from all through her life that she kept in touch with and visited whenever possible.  As long as she was physically able, a once a month Saturday ritual for us was for the two of to walk around town (Blanchard) to stop in on friends --  Mrs. Jarmon, Mrs. Cochenaur, Grandma Pierson and Vernie, Azzie &amp; Abe, and on and on.  We often would take her to see other friends around the state.  Grandma NEVER had much money - but she was GOLDEN in her caring about her friends and family.

I mention it at this point in the story because Callie was probably her dearest friend.  She would've never have used the term "soulmate" but they had a connection from their early life and trials that no later friends could quite match.  "Aunt Callie" was a part of our life until her death.  She had a boarding house in Oklahoma City that I barely remember (and no one else in the family does remember) where we would take Grandma to visit with her until Callie's death.

I'm using the 1/2 designation for this chapter, simply because I really don't know how the trial turned out!  I have contacted Callie's great-niece and none of the living relatives know either.   Several hours spent by me pouring over Cleveland County court records and newspaper accounts produced nothing after her arrest and charge with her brother's murder and her plea of self-defense.  I did find several other interesting 1922 headlines, though:  "TOTAL NUMBER OF MILES OF PAVED ROADS IN NORMAN -- 6.4" "FORD TOWN CAR - $348" "NORMAN DECLARED FREE OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES"  "CATTLE SHOULDN'T EAT COCKLE BURRS"  all front page news!

Grandma's and others' accounts of the character witness testimony are all I have from the trial.  Looking back, I guess I always assumed she was found not guilty -- because she was certainly out of jail 25 years later when I was born.  And no one ever mentioned the events in front of her as I'm sure it was "old news" by then.

So let's just "go" with the story that the jury found her "not guilty by reason of self-defense" and let it go at that.  She was certainly a typical "sweet old lady" when I knew her -- I don't think she was ever carrying that 38 revolver that she used to pump 6 shots into her brother's direction (the one to his mouth was the one that led to his death after lingering about a month - according to newspaper accounts!).  But I must admit, I LOVED watching her and trying to picture her taking revenge like an Okie Calamity Jane.
