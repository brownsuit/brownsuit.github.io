Uncle Jackson and Pa had decided there was a better life to be had further West.  As long as they were together, Florence didn’t mind a move.  Anywhere would HAVE to have fewer tall trees, and Florence longed to be able to see the sky without tree branches blocking the view.  In fact, her whole life she wanted to live where she could see the horizon.  I suspect that those tall pines held too many frightening memories deep in her heart.  

The two families started making plans.  Uncle Jackson had a team and he had bought a covered wagon for the trip and to live out of for as long as they needed to when they got to the new place.  Other friends and family members had moved before them, and wrote back telling how rich the soil was and how thick the cattle were, and how much room there was for someone wanting to find a better life.  There was even a city named “Paris” .  It had to be the promised land!  Aunt Molly was a bit skeptical, but she wanted to see the sky almost as much as Florence.  Pa had promised to finish clearing a pasture for a neighbor, so it was decided that he would stay and finish that job, then ride the train, or catch a ride with someone else headed that way, at a later date.  Florence, Lizzie and Lige would travel with Uncle Jack’s family to the new homeland.  Florence worried about this a little, but Pa had spoken in that tone that meant no arguing, so she got all their things ready for the trip.  They would have to take turns walking and riding in the wagon for the six weeks or so that the trip would take, to lighten the load for the horses…and use up a lot of youthful energy.

The morning they left was a cloudy day.  Florence hoped that wasn’t a “sign”.  She’d begun to accumulate a number of superstitions that would last for a lifetime.  Her uncle told her it was her Cherokee blood that brought that out in her.  She just thought that a lot of bad things had happened so far, and it would be a little bit of a comfort to think that there were signs that she should be watching.  For example:  Never pass a white horse, without (1) making a wish, (2) licking your right thumb, pressing it into your left palm and stamping the spot with your right fist, and (3) NEVER, share the wish with anyone!  Not only did Florence keep that superstition her whole life, so has her daughter, granddaughter, and so on! This author has tried to pass a white horse, without giving in, but just can’t!

Anyway, in spite of “A cloudy day means tears on the way”, the little group struck out for Texas.   Father had given each of the children $20 for their needs on the trip.  A HUGE amount in 1898!  Lizzie had spent hers before they got across Mississippi.  Florence would stubbornly deny herself and was so proud to give father back the $20 when he reached Texas!  Florence’s stoic and stubborn nature also showed on the trip in another way.  She refused to ride at all, giving up her seat either to Lige or Lizzie and walked all the way to Texas.  One of her proudest moments was when Uncle Jack told her father, “Well, your little “Daught” is just as spunky as you said.  She walked the whole way with me!”

Texas wasn’t Paradise, but, when Pa got there  by train just a couple of weeks after they arrived Florence’s world was complete.  He had once again kept his word, and she could see the sky!  Of course, she remained in awe of just how MUCH sky there was in Texas!
