<p>Dedicated to my precious grandmother,<br />
Florence Adella Smith Harris,<br />
And to my children and grandchildren she prepared me to cherish:</p>
<p>                          Kimberly and Ryan,<br />
Caleb, Samuel, Abby, Ethan and Myles –<br />
Her Cherokee, Scoth &amp; Irish blood flows in your veins.</p>
<p>Prologue…..</p>
<p><em>Florence tried to understand what the doctor was saying.  It was 1951 and he was explaining that her fainting spells were caused by a bad heart valve.  It was leaking and letting blood pass through her heart without getting the oxygen it needed.  At least that’s what she thought he said.  What she knew was that she was going to have to be careful because her heart was quite literally “broken”.  In 1951 the only treatment for her condition was lots of rest and a daily dose  of digitalis.  The doctor said she’d probably had this condition for years after all, she was 65 and had lived a hard life…but Florence knew precisely the moment her heart had broken, and it wasn’t that long ago…..</em></p>
<p>Before the "story" begins, I want to share with you that this is based on "oral history" of my grandmother and our family that she shared with me over 50 years ago.  My memory is NOT faultless, and I have changed some names (to protect descendants of the guilty!!).  But to the best of my memory and the best of HER memory, these events really did happen.  She was an amazing woman -- although she would've said she was quite ordinary.  I think you'll agree with me if you read mine and my grandmother's musings in the chapters ahead!</p>
