<em>As Florence left the examination room she thought about how she was going to tell the girls and Dezmer about this.  They would be upset. “ Heart Trouble” was frightening, and in the fifties, there was very little to do about it.  There would be questions, and the doctor had given her few answers! There would be many more changes to face in her habits… Changes… there had been so many in her life when all she’d ever really wanted since she could remember was for things to stay the same!  She thought back to that day when she was about ten years old,  when everything in her life changed once again!</em>

She had supper ready, and Lige was working on his ciphering when she heard Pa  coming onto the porch.  “Daught, Lige, are you in there?  I have a surprise!”  
The two ran to the door as he opened it, then grabbed him in that bear hug that they so looked forward to.  They looked past Pa to see a young woman standing behind him holding a satchel, looking very unsure.  They all stopped and stared.  
Pa had brought home another new wife!  And this one looked much younger than the last one!  What was he thinking?  
They turned their gaze up to Pa, who was watching them with a smirk on his face, reading their thoughts.  “Florence, Elijah, I want you to meet Elizabeth, your………sister!”  “Sister!?”  
Florence thought, “Why, she’s just a few years older than me.  This doesn’t make sense!”  Pa broke into her thoughts, “I know you have a hundred questions…just save them until after supper.  Right now, I can smell that old rooster cooking for his sins of spurring Lige, can’t I?  He smells great!  Let’s eat and talk later”.
Pa would later explain to Florence and Lige  about “Lizzie”.  Florence would share the story with me many years later, after exacting a promise to keep it a secret… just as she had promised her father.  
I’m not going to break that promise now.  Just suffice it to say that Lizzie was about three years older than Florence and had been raised by her mother, until Lemuel went to check on her that day and decided she would be better off living with his family.  There was no looking back, and while Florence could never quite feel the same about Lizzie that she did Lige, she welcomed her into the family and did her best to please her father by accepting her new sister.  While he treated all three children well, Florence always understood that she and her Father shared a bond that the others didn’t.   
Later in life she and Lizzie’s lives took similar paths to marriage and motherhood and their children grew up together as family.  And even through my generation all the second and third cousins are still “family”!  
So, while this change upset her world for a while, her heart was still whole!
