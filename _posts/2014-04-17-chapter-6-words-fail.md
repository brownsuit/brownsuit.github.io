Life settled into a routine again.  Pa and Lige working and Julia and Florence taking care of the home.  Florence started having health problems.  Pa thought he really knew all about “woman” problems – having been married 5 or 6 times  -   because of her age he assumed that’s what was wrong.  Once again,  Lige had an opinion, courtesy of his friend’s mother.  She told him to get “Beef, Iron and Wine” tonic for Florence the next time the patent medicine salesman came around.  Florence was to take a dose every morning to get her blood built up for her “monthly”.  It tasted awful, but the men in the family insisted that she take it, and since everyone in the county seemed to know about her problems, she did!  Julia kept her opinion of their diagnosis to herself!  Whether it had any effect or not, Florence’s “monthlys” did start soon after, and her health improved.  She was convinced  it had “done the trick” and later would force the same awful stuff on her daughters (and at least one granddaughter !)  

Unfortunately, tragedy returned to the family.  A few weeks later, while visiting his friends, Lige “took a chill” and was given  the last few ounces of a bottle of “chill tonic”.  He went into a coma and died within a couple of hours.  Of course, there was no way to ever know exactly what caused his untimely death.  Florence always thought it was that too many chemicals had settled in that last bit of the chill tonic and had killed him.  She would never again take medicine without shaking the bottle vigorously and throwing away the last few ounces of whatever it was.  Florence and Pa were both devastated.  She and Lige had always been especially close,  going through so many hard times together.  She adored her younger brother so much, and doubted that anything could ever hurt that much again.

It seemed that trouble had come to “stay and not pass”.   Just weeks later,   Palmer developed what was called “croup” at the time.  Without antibiotics, his condition worsened rapidly and he died.  Julia never seemed to recover from the loss.  She was expecting at the time, and both she and the baby girl died in childbirth just a month later.

Suddenly, there were four family members in the Sawyer cemetery.  It was overwhelming for Florence,  and Pa was in despair.  His sobs as he stood over the fresh graves were something she would never forget.  He was so strong.  Somehow this second time she’d seen him cry didn’t weaken him in her eyes, though.  Being older than the first time, she knew that sometimes the tears just had to come out, and had nothing to do with strength, but with having a heart!  He vowed never to remarry (which Florence thought was a really good idea, given his track record and age!).  Many years later she would tell me this story again as we put flowers on these graves in the Sawyer cemetery.
