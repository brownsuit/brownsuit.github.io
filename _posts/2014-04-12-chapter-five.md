Pa had always been troubled by his “half-breed status”. He really never mentioned it much, because there were many others in Alabama who, like him, had Cherokee ancestors. His grandfather was full blood and according to family history, had signed away all rights to stay with his Scotch-Irish wife. Pa made it plain that this was not a subject to talk about, so Florence never asked more. The author really wishes she had as this is an area of our ancestry that is very difficult to trace!!
After a while in Texas, times were hard. “Paradise” never seemed to arrive, so Pa cast his eyes north across the Red River into the Indian Territory. Rumor had it that it was going to become a state soon and now was the time to get a start there, and maybe have a chance to have a better life. Before leaving Texas, though, Pa had married again. Julia was a sweet woman, who made the three children feel safe again. She genuinely seemed to care for Pa, even though there was a huge age difference. They had just had twins, two sweet boys, Palmer and Elmer. Elmer was smaller and frail and only lived a few days. Palmer seemed to be fine and the whole family welcomed him <strong>They even had a family picture made before leaving Texas – Lemuel, Julia, Lizzie, Florence, Lige and Palmer (pronounced “Pal – mer”.</strong>

They moved into Choctaw territory, Father doing “day laborer” type jobs. Florence made a “forever friend” in a neighbor girl, Callie. The two girls were so close that I was a grown woman before realizing that “Aunt” Callie was related by heart strings and not bloodline. Hers is one of many graves that I put flowers on “for my grandma” each Memorial Day more than a century after their friendship began.
Callie and Florence talked their parents into letting them go into Sawyer to a carnival. In later years, nearby Hugo would be the winter headquarters of several large circuses, but this time it was just a traveling carnival that had come to town. The girls had never seen such a sight! Dancing girls with hardly anything on urged men to come in and see the wonders of “Arabie” and women with beards! Whoever heard of such a thing! They found themselves in front of a tent advertising “Phrenology, The Science of the Future!” The girls stopped long enough for the woman to talk them into giving her a nickel and coming into her tent to find out their “fortunes”. Callie went first. “Oh, I see a handsome man in your future. He will be your one true love.” The woman was massaging Callie’s scalp with her eyes closed. It turned out Phrenology was the science of feeling the bumps on the girls’ heads! She continued…” He will adore you and will build you a wonderful home and fill it with lovely things!” “What about children?” Callie questioned? The woman suddenly stopped and stammered…”uh, that’s all. No more to see, sorry”. Callie persevered, “But I want to know more, please!” “No, that is all for now…sometimes the future is hidden for a purpose, accept it.” Callie was disappointed, but said “Go ahead, Florence, do yours now.”
Florence was afraid. For one thing, she really wasn’t used to being touched by strangers, and for another, she wasn’t sure she really wanted to know about any more tragedy in her life! But, the woman began, “I see a man wearing a brown suit. He is walking into your yard to ask directions. He is the man you will marry, although at first, you would be ready to fight with anyone who would suggest it!” Callie persisted…”tell her more, will THEY have children?” Again, the woman stopped. “That is enough for a nickel”. The girls were disappointed, but left the tent giggling about their future husbands, and went over to find something exciting to eat before heading home.

Florence told her brother and stepmother about the fortune teller. Lige said he’d heard about phrenology and his friend’s mother, who really knew all about “patent” medicines and such had a book about it. He promised to find out more for the girls.
