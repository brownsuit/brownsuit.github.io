The <strong>"War to End All Wars"</strong> was going strong in Europe and “Uncle Sam” had sent out the call for more men.  Andrew’s youngest brother, Alford,  decided he would do his duty and sign up since he wasn’t married and felt someone in the family should.  None of them knew much about the reasons for the war, but the government had asked, so he answered! The family all gathered to cheer the boys at the train station in Ft. Towson and hugged and kissed him goodbye.  Andrew envied the proud look on Alford’s face as he saluted as the train moved out of the station.  “I reckon if I didn’t have a family to care for, I’d be up there with him!”  But, farmers were supposed to stay on the farm and produce for the war effort.  They were all sure it wouldn’t last long now that the “dough boys” were flooding Europe!  It was several weeks before they received his first letter, short and sweet:

<em> “Don’t have much time to write, but the Captain says I must!  We’re in France!!  We hope to see “Gay Parie” before the end of the month  when  we run those Huns out!  We’re out in the countryside now.  Don’t worry about me.  I figure the enemy is running as fast as they can to stay ahead of us territory boys!!!  I love you, Mama. (s) your loving soldier son, Alford” .</em>

The letter would be his last….


The telegram fell from Elizabeth’s hand as she started to read.... “We regret to inform you of the death of your son,  pfc Alford Harris…”   Katie came running into the room as she heard her mother’s sobs.    “Mama!  What’s wrong…????”   Elizabeth just kept saying over and over, “My boy, my sweet, sweet boy”.  The telegraph operator had alerted several people in town and they gathered in the home.  Someone got word to Andrew , Frank and Evie and the family gathered.  A letter from the Red Cross and also from the Secretary of War would explain that he fell in France and was buried in Trey-en-bay in a U.S. military cemetery.  A photo of the cross on his grave would be sent letter along with the “thanks of a grateful nation” and a monthly pension for Mrs. Wood.    It  still makes me sad to look at the faces of promise on the three handsome young men in the portrait my great-grandmother had taken of her three sons before Alford left for Europe and had hung on her parlor wall only weeks before receiving the awful news.  It hung on my grandmother's wall until her death, too.[caption id="attachment_138" align="alignnone" width="202"]<a href="../images/harris-brothers.jpg"><img src="../images/harris-brothers-202x300.jpg" alt="Andrew, Frank &amp; Alford Harris" width="202" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-138" /></a> Andrew, Frank &amp; Alford Harris[/caption] Mrs. Wood never really did recover from the loss of her youngest son – for that matter never did really understand why he was thousands of miles across the sea fighting the “Huns”!  Elizabeth  is buried in the Coleman Cemetary and the writer and her family visit her grave each time we pass through southeastern Oklahoma and put flowers on her grave – blue ones that I know her son, my grandpa, Andrew, would’ve picked for her.  
   <strong>  <em>A side note:  I would learn from the "other side" of my family tree that while my great-uncle was dying in France, and few hundred miles away in Rahau, Romania, my great-grandparents and a great uncle were dying from influenza and their son - my grandfather, who had come a few years earlier to the United States to earn money and go back home, would be prevented from doing that by the war and the "commies" and would meet and marry my grandmother 7 years later and have my father!!!  Citizenship for him would come many years later.  It may not have been "The War To End All Wars" but the events set in motion during that time are still echoing through generations!!!</em><strong></strong>
