        Florence had  gone out in the back yard to watch 
Pa split logs with his huge axe.  Suddenly, he slipped and blood gushed from his foot.  He dropped the axe and pulled off his shirt, wrapping it around the injured foot.  “Daught, you’ve got to go get help from Uncle Jackson, quick!” “ But, Pa,  it’s so far, and through the woods!  I’m afraid!” was her reply.  “Well, I guess you’re right.  Just sit down beside me her and stay with me while I die, ‘cause for sure I’m bleeding to death.”
      She started running through the woods to her uncle’s farm.  They made the trip back quickly, for Uncle Jack was prosperous enough to have a horse.  He took care of Lemuel, sewing up the gash with horsehair and pouring kerosene over it.  He recovered but often had a slight limp when the weather changed, he said it was a reminder to keep a firm grip on whatever life hands you!
The next few years were ones of living frugally (“Wasteful  strife makes woeful wants” was one of  Pa’s favorite sayings) off the land.

       One day her father returned from town with a surprise – a new stepmother!  Her name was Dot  (probably Dorothy) and she really could “put on airs” according to the relatives!  Florence and Lige didn’t really know what to make of her.  When Pa was there, she was always kind and interested in the 8 and 5 year old.  But when he was working, she was distant and cold.  One day, Dot had taken lunch out to Lemuel and Florence decided to follow, since that had always been her job.  Just as she came upon them, she could tell there was an argument going on.  From what she heard, Dot was asking him to send the children away to relatives.  She just wasn’t “cut out” to take care of some other woman’s brats.  She just knew that she and Lemuel could have a wonderful life, if they just started out fresh, with no "baggage".  Florence couldn’t hear what her father said.  The blood was gushing through the veins in her ears so loudly that all she could hear was the voice of panic in her head…”He’s going to send us away…but he promised!!”  She ran back home and hugged her baby brother and cried.  Lige was really used to this by now!  When she saw Dot coming toward the house, she and Lige slipped out the back and hid back by the smokehouse.  A little later they saw her set two suitcases out on the front porch about the same time Father came in from the woods.  The children held their breath as they saw the two of them talking.  Pa took some money out of his pocket and handed to her, then she picked up the two cases and started walking down the road!
Pa went into the house and they hear him calling “Daught, Lige, where are you?”  They went running to him and he picked them both up in a bear hug.  “Oh, Pa, we thought you were sending US away!” Florence sobbed.  “Daught, didn’t I tell you that you could always count on me?”  “Yes, Pa, but Dot is your wife.”  “Truth is, as I told Dot, you kids were here before she came, and you’d be here if she’s a mind to leave. It's her decision!” 
           Florence never doubted her Pa’s word again!  Life settled back into a routine, until a few years later when Pa came home from town with another surprise!
