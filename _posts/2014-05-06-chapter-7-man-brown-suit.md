 A few months before Lige’s death, Florence had been feeding the chickens one day when she saw someone coming up the road.  As he got closer, her heart skipped a beat!  It was a young man, about her age, wearing a brown suit.  He walked up to their gate and paused asking, “Miss, Could you tell me where the McAlester place is?”  Florence couldn’t answer, try as she may!  “Miss, are you alright?”  “She’s fine, just a little tongue tied”.  It was Lige’s voice behind her.  He walked up to the man chuckling and holding out his hand. “She ain’t used to seeing a good lookin’ feller I reckon!  My name’s Elijah Smith, and this here is my big sister, Florence”.    “Pleased to meet you.   I’m Andrew Harris.  I heard that the McAlester’s were looking for some help on their place.  Do you know them?”   He and Lige went on to discuss where they lived and what Lige knew about the family.  Andrew’s mother lived over at Coleman with her new husband, John Wood.  His father was still in Texas somewhere.  He was looking to strike out on his own and trying to find a job as a farmhand.  He thanked Lige, tipped his hat at Florence (still mute) and headed on down the road.

<strong>Andrew Harris a few years earlier</strong>
“Well, well, well” said Lige. “ Won’t it be nice to have an eligible young man so close by?”  Florence punched him as she walked back over to the chickens, “Don’t be silly.  He just scared me, that’s all”.  Lige couldn’t resist teasing her every chance he got the next few weeks about Andrew.  She got madder and madder, but she couldn’t get the blond headed young man out of her mind.  She couldn’t help but think back about the phrenologist’s words, “and if anyone suggested you were sweet on each other, you’d be ready to fight!”.

        Andrew got the job with the neighbor’s and just happened to walk by every few days after that.  Florence had to admit that it always made her heart skip a beat when she saw him…although he never had on the brown suit – just work clothes.  She couldn’t forget the phrenologist’s prediction.  Her friend Callie was being courted by a  wonderful young man who had a dry goods store over at Tishomingo and her sister, Lizzie, had  run off and married Callie’s older brother, Low Dyson (some names have been changed for reasons that will become obvious!)   They had moved back over to Arkansas where the Dyson’s had lots of extended family.  Pa was really worried about Lizzie because the men in the family had a bad reputation for being drunks and womanizers.  Florence was so glad that it didn’t hurt her friendship with Callie for him to feel the way he did about her brothers.  In fact, Callie had said more than once that they were a worthless lot, except for Low, and she couldn’t wait to find a good man to marry and be out from under their control.  Florence knew the bruises she would see on Callie weren’t always accidents.  When Ben asked Mr. Dyson for Callie’s hand, he insisted on a dowry payment, which Ben provided, and Callie became Mrs. Ben Young!  They built a beautiful new house in Tishomingo – not a mansion – but wonderful by any standards.  Florence was so happy for her friend, and wondered when (and if)  her secret dreams might come true!  Callie and Ben even went on a trip back east so he could introduce his wife to his family.  When they came back, Florence had never seen anyone so happy as those two.  

        Andrew started coming by a lot more often, and finally asked Pa if he could court Florence.  Pa was not at all sure he liked the idea, but Daught was  19 – almost 20 – and he guessed it was time to think about her starting her life.  She had always asked so little of him, and taken on burdens from the time she was six that no girl should have.<a href="http://brownsuit.ryan-day.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2014/05/harris-wedding-photo.jpg"><img src="http://brownsuit.ryan-day.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2014/05/harris-wedding-photo-245x300.jpg" alt="harris wedding photo" width="245" height="300" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-74" /></a>    


    So,  He gave his blessing to the courtship.  Florence no longer “felt like fighting” if anyone suggested she liked Andrew!  After a few months, Florence and Andrew “tied the knot” with Callie and Ben as witnesses and began their life together. <strong>Their wedding photo is above...</strong>. I've always thought they looked about 14!   To say Florence was ignorant of what to expect from marriage is an understatement!  With very little womanly influence, and a father who repeatedly told her that “all men only wanted one thing from a woman” she really was frightened that she would not know how to “please” Andrew.  But in her tight-lipped fashion, she never let on her misgivings and would NEVER talk about that part of her marriage to anyone!  They settled into married  life, living in a small house on the farm where Andrew worked as a “hand”.  Life was not especially hard for the times and they did just fine.   It was just a few months when Florence realized that something about her body was different.  She felt nauseated when she’s be cooking breakfast for Andrew and was so tired!  One day her Pa said, “Daught, I think you’re with child!”  He should know, she thought, how many wives had he seen in that condition????  There really weren’t many doctors in the territory.  Andrew borrowed a buggy and drove her to Ft. Towson to see one.  He gave her a cursory checkup and confirmed Pa’s diagnosis.  Of course neither one of them had any idea how far along she was in the pregnancy because her earlier “female problems” still were with her.  It seemed like she carried that child for a full year – and maybe she did!  When Leeo Jackson Harris came into the world kicking and screaming and completely healthy at 14 pounds 11 ounces,  Florence was beside herself with joy!  Callie came over to stay with her and help her out for a few weeks.  Florence could see the sadness in Callie’s eye when she held the baby because she still had not conceived.  The fortune tellers words rang in her ears.  Florence’s health returned and Leeo flourished!  He was the most beautiful baby she’d ever seen and so happy.  The little family was complete.  Times were hard, but good!  Oklahoma was now a state instead of Indian Territory and the future looked bright!  Andrew’s father came up from Texas to see the family and at Florence’s urging stayed with them as they moved over by Davis.  Mr. Harris doted on Leeo and, though he was in poor health,  would watch him while Florence worked in the field.  Andrew’s mother and her second husband lived over by Coleman.  No one ever talked about why his parents had divorced, and  Andrew didn’t really know, even though he was the oldest of the five children.  His parents never talked badly about each other to him or the other children.  His father never remarried and his mother was a single mother with two daughters and a son still at home for several years before she married Mr. Wood.  Florence realized how fortunate they all were that Mr. Wood was a good man who provided well for Andrew’s mother and children.  Life was good!
